,"Because the average region has fewer than 90 parks, some will likely be affected. In a region with only 17 heritage parks, a small number, approximately 3 would likely be affected due to the limited total of heritage parks.",,,,,,,,

Relationship:,Common cause,"The relationship between the Total number of Heritage sites (x) and the amount affected by Climate Change (y) is a common cause relationship. An external variable, which is climate change (z), is causing an increase in affected sites (y) out of the total amount of heritage sites (x)",,,,,,,
